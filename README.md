# scikit-learn-basics-for-study
This is a scikit-learn notebook with base coding as a reminder/cheatsheet for further projects!

## Includes:
- An end-to-end sklearn workflow
- Getting the data ready
- Choose the right algorithm for our problem
- Fit the model and use it to make predictions on our data
- Evaluating the model
- Improve the model
- Save/load a trained model
- Putting it all together

## Techniques:
- sklearn RandomForestClassifier
- classification report, confusion matrix, accuracy score
- ColumnTransformer and OneHotEncoder
- filling of the missing values (SimpleImputer)
- evaluation metrics (area under curve - AUC, ROC curve, accuracy, precision, recall, f1)
- visualizing using Seaborn's heatmap
